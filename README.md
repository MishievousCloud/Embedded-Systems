# Thermostat-Embedded-System
I created a Thermostat prototype that detects temperature, indicates the function of heat on/off and utilizes button interrupts to drive the set temperature all while simulating an upload to the cloud via Wi-Fi that displays the temperature data.
# Morse-Code-Embedded-System
I created a Morse code unit that uses GPIO interrupts via button input to flash an LED to output SOS or OK in Morse Code.
